I worked alone to create a Reverse Polish Notation calculator which functions on text files formatted to use stacks or queues.

I built each of the stack and queue classes, then constructed the algorithms necessary to process the data in each of these structures,
perform the necessary calculations, and generate a correct result. 

Using stacks, I implemented a data stack/operand stack algorithm structure to complete my calculations.

I implemented two separate algorithms when implementing the data queue.
First, I used an operand stack to recieve numbers from the queue and use that information to perform calculations when operators were dequeued.
Second, I used a simple algorithm to process and calculate results from data pulled directly from the queue.
