In a world full people just waiting to meet, the tinderverse helps all those blind ships lost at sea find thier perfect match!

Below are the instructions for how to access and utilize this priceless tool of love:
1) Open the project contained within this zip folder in eclipse
2) Open the source file titled "myTinderNetwork.java"
3) Run the program and follow the expertly crafted on-screen instructions
	-First, search for an existing user in the database by copy/pasting user info into the prompted fields from the 
	 included "users.json" file
		*Examine the blazing speed of the algorithm as it displays the time it took to find that user's matches
	-Next, create/search for the matches of a new user by following the on-screen instructions
		*Witness the blinding speed as the new user's matches are found by the supperior Tinderverse algorithms
4)Have fun messing with the radius of the tinderverse users, the new users, and the locations of the new tinderites looking
  for love.


	Thank you so much for being an awesome professor this semester! I came into the class knowing quite a bit about data 
structures and, despite that, I still feel like I learned so much. I think the fun examples, the interactive class activities,
and the engaging projects really helped me learn the material. I also really liked that you brought pepper to class on Fridays!
I hope you have a great winter break and I hope to see you next semester!
